    "7. Secure the rolled tortilla by inserting 5 toothpicks about 1 inch apart.\n",
    "8. Trim the ends of the tortilla roll with the butter knife, leaving 1⁄2 inch margin between the last\n",
    "toothpick and the end of the roll. Discard ends.\n",
    "9. Slide floss under the tortilla, perpendicular to the length of the roll. Place the floss halfway\n",
    "between two toothpicks.\n",

    "### Instructions\n",
    "1. Measure 12 ounces of cold water and transfer to a kettle.\n",
    "2. While the water is boiling, assemble the filter cone. Place the dripper on top of a coffee mug.\n",
    "3. Prepare the filter insert by folding the paper filter in half to create a semi-circle, and in half again\n",

    "4. Weigh the coffee beans and grind until the coffee grounds are the consistency of course sand,\n",
    "about 20 seconds. Transfer the grounds to the filter cone.\n",
    "5. Once the water has boiled, check the temperature. The water should be between 195-205\n",
    "degrees Fahrenheit or between 91-96 degrees Celsius. If the water is too hot, let it cool briefly.\n",
    "6. Pour a small amount of water in the filter to wet the grounds. Wait for coffee to bloom, about\n",
    "30 seconds. You will see small bubbles or foam on the coffee grounds during this step.\n",
    "7. Slowly pour the rest of the water over the grounds in a circular motion. Do not overfill beyond\n",
    "the top of the paper filter.\n",
    "8. Let the coffee drain completely into the mug before removing the dripper. Discard the paper\n",
    "filter and coffee grounds."
