    "\n",
    "### Ingredients\n",
    " - 12 oz water\n",
    " - 25 grams whole coffee beans\n",
    " - Tools and Utensils\n",
    " - 2-cup liquid measuring cup electric kettle\n",
    " - kitchen scale\n",
    " - coffee grinder\n",
    " - filter cone dripper (stainless steel)\n",
    " - paper basket filter (standard 8-12 cup size) 12-ounce coffee mug\n",
    " - thermometer\n",
    " - timer (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "1. Measure 12 ounces of cold water and transfer to a kettle.\n",
    "2. While the water is boiling, assemble the filter cone. Place the dripper on top of a coffee mug.\n",
    "3. Prepare the filter insert by folding the paper filter in half to create a semi-circle, and in half again\n",
    "to create a quarter-circle. Place the paper filter in the dripper and spread open to create a cone.\n",
    "4. Weigh the coffee beans and grind until the coffee grounds are the consistency of course sand,\n",
    "about 20 seconds. Transfer the grounds to the filter cone.\n",
    "5. Once the water has boiled, check the temperature. The water should be between 195-205\n",
    "degrees Fahrenheit or between 91-96 degrees Celsius. If the water is too hot, let it cool briefly.\n",
    "6. Pour a small amount of water in the filter to wet the grounds. Wait for coffee to bloom, about\n",
    "30 seconds. You will see small bubbles or foam on the coffee grounds during this step.\n",
    "7. Slowly pour the rest of the water over the grounds in a circular motion. Do not overfill beyond\n",
    "the top of the paper filter.\n",
    "8. Let the coffee drain completely into the mug before removing the dripper. Discard the paper\n",
    "filter and coffee grounds."

    "5. Whisk batter until no lumps remain.\n",
    "6. Pour batter into prepared mug.\n",
    "7. Microwave the mug and batter on high power for 60 seconds.\n",
    "8. Check the cake for doneness; it should be mostly dry and springy at the top. If the cake still looks wet, microwave for an additional 5 seconds.\n",
    "9. Invert the mug to release the cake onto a place. Carefully remove paper liner.\n",
    "10. While the cake is cooling, prepare to pipe the frosting. Scoop a spoonful of chocolate frosting\n",
    "into a zip-top bag and seal, removing as much air as possible.\n",
    "11. Use scissors to cut one corner from the bag to create a small opening 1⁄4-inch in diameter.\n",
    "12. Squeeze the frosting through the opening to apply small dollops of frosting to the plate in a\n",
    "circle around the base of the cake."
