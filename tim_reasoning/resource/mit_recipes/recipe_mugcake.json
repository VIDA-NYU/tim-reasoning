      "Whisk to combine.",
      "Measure and add the oil, water, and vanilla to the bowl.",
      "Whisk batter until no lumps remain.",
      "Pour batter into prepared mug.",
      "Microwave the mug and batter on high power for 60 seconds.",
      "Check if the cake is done by inserting and toothpick into the center of the cake and then removing. If wet batter clings to the toothpick, microwave for an additional 5 seconds. If the toothpick comes out clean, continue.",
      "Invert the mug to release the cake onto a plate. Allow to cool until it is no longer hot to the touch, then carefully remove paper liner.",
      "While the cake is cooling, prepare to pipe the frosting. Scoop 4 spoonfuls of chocolate frosting into a zip-top bag and seal, removing as much air as possible.",
      "Use scissors to cut one corner from the bag to create a small opening 1/4-inch in diameter.",
      "Squeeze the frosting through the opening to apply small dollops of frosting to the plate in a circle around the base of the cake."
